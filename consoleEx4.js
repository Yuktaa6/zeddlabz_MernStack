console.log("7" > 7);         // Output: false ==>  JS will convert string "7" to a number. So,it becomes 7 > 7. Since the values are equal, it is false.
console.log("2" > "21");     // Output: true ==> the first character '2' is compared to '2', and they are equal. Then, second character '2' is compared to '1',& it is greater than '1'. hence,true.
console.log("KL" > "S");     // Output: false ==>The first characters are 'K' and 'S'. Since 'K' comes before 'S' in the sequence,So it is false.
